## What is Aikido?

Aikido is a modern Japanese martial art that focuses on self-defense techniques and the philosophy of harmony and non-resistance. It was developed by Morihei Ueshiba in the early 20th century. Aikido techniques include joint locks, throws, and pins, and practitioners learn to apply these techniques in a fluid and dynamic manner.
